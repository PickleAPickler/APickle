# Tic-Tac-Toe Playground # :o::heavy_multiplication_x:🧪


Welcome to experiments with Tic-Tac-Toe! 

Based on a terminal version of TTT, this repo contains tests, intentional bugs and alternate forms of the game. All in progress - it is also a log of learning to code. What you will find:

* Main TTT game
  
* TTT Tests:
- Fill the line -> a test version of entering X and O markers on a line
- 'Display board' game -> The board being shown is the game. Whoa!
- Wins Only ->  You can only win. Good for the ego. 

* Bug versions
- Replay Error -> The game intro starts, but there's no game. Asks for a replay instead


In progress: 

* No winner or loser. Just a full board ends the game
*  No pleasantries versions
  - you are assigned either an X or O and you just go from there 
  - no 'ready to play' option, the games loop just starts
  - no order of play, you're just go first or second. Also no 'you will go first' etc.

My learning:

- Learning to debug
- Python tests
- Making GUI in TKinter
- Learning Web Dev in Python through Flask
