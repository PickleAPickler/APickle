# Tic-Tac-Toe Playground  :o::heavy_multiplication_x:🧪


 Welcome to experiments with Tic-Tac-Toe! 

Based on a terminal version of Tic-Tac-Toe (TTT), this repo contains tests, intentional bugs and alternate forms of the game. What you will find:

## Main TTT game 
 The game in its unaltered state
  
## TTT Tests:
- Fill the line -> a test version of entering X and O markers on a line
- Display board 'game' -> The board being shown <em> is </em> the game (with option to replay) 
- Wins Only ->  You can only win.  

## Bug versions
- Replay Error -> The game intro starts, but there's no game. Asks for a replay instead


## In progress: 

* No winner or loser. Just a full board ends the game
* 'No pleasantries' versions:
  - you are assigned either an X or O and you just go from there 
  - no 'ready to play' option, the games loop just starts
  - no order of play, you just go first or second. Also no 'you will go first' etc.

### My learning:
