# Tic-Tac-Toe Playground  :o::heavy_multiplication_x:🧪


 Welcome to experiments with Tic-Tac-Toe! 

 Based on a terminal version of Tic-Tac-Toe (TTT) from Pierian Data's Python Bootcamp https://github.com/Pierian-Data/Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp
 
 This repo contains tests and refactored forms of the game. Just copy and paste the code into a Python editor and hit play. 

## Main TTT game (TTT_Full.py)
 The game in its unaltered state
  
## TTT Tests:
- Fill the row (TTT_RowTest.py) -> a test version of entering X and O markers on a line 
- Display board 'game' (TTT_Display_game.py) -> The board being shown <em> is </em> the game (with option to replay) 
- Wins Only (TTT_WinsOnly.py) ->  You can only win.  

## In progress: 

* No winner or loser. Just a full board ends the game
* 'No pleasantries' versions:
  - no 'ready to play' option, the games loop just starts (TTT_QuickStart.py)
  - you are assigned either an X or O and you just go from there 
  - no order of play, you just go first or second. Also no 'you will go first' etc.

### My learning:

- Learning to debug
- Python tests
- Making GUIs
- Learning Web Dev in Python through Flask
